vanguard says expense ratio is 0.04%

adjusted closing price accounts for expense ratio, but can also calculate it myself
ex-dividend day is reinvestment day
use yfinance for data

portfoliovisualizer email says: NAV and price per share of mutual funds and ETFs already reflects the expense ratio.

Instead, each fund's expenses are deducted from its total value on a regular basis. And those expenses cut directly into your investment returns.

so stock price AND adjusted closing price both account for expense ratio
but stock price and dividend and split calculation manually seems to be the tiniest bit more accurate

market timing isn't correct for some reason with the expenses, but I'm not sure why... says 66% of the time it'll work when rich, broke, or dead says 98% of time.
